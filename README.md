### Using Advanced Scripts (POST, PUT Requests)  

Phantom-Scripter also supports more advanced use cases like sending HTTP requests (POST, PUT, etc.) with custom payloads. You can define these in the editor or the script configuration.  

#### Example: Sending a POST Request  
If you want to send a `POST` request with JSON data, define a script like this:  

```yaml
scripts:
  script-1:
    command: '!new-status'
    input: https://api.example.com/new-status && {"status":"active"}
    type: POST request
```

Hereâ€™s how it works:  
- `command` is the trigger you type (`!lock`).  
- `input` is the API endpoint followed by `&&` and the JSON payload.  
- `type` is `Run command`, which tells Phantom-Scripter to execute it.  

#### Example: Sending a PUT Request  
If you need to send a `PUT` request, use a similar approach:  

```yaml
scripts:
  script-2:
    command: '!update-status'
    input: https://api.example.com/update-status && {"status":"active"}
    type: PUT request
```

### General Format for API Requests  
The syntax follows this pattern:  

```
<URL> && <JSON payload>
```

- `&&` separates the URL and the data.

### Additional Tips  
- Ensure the API you are calling allows CORS if needed.  
- If your API requires authentication, you may need to handle API keys separately.  
- For GET requests, simply use the URL without `&&`.
